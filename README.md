This project aims to be a Smart Home simulation, but I replaced home appliances with 10 LEDs, because I'm homeless (just a joke, there you go).

Full details about this project are in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OLq9W__4aBerfr6Xwyw8l9VsRiEpy2Sf1CGOlpufIVI/edit#slide=id.p).

This branch contains the Server implementation.
The client is implemented in the [android_client branch](https://github.com/mhashim6/Voice-Controlled-Pi/tree/android_client).
